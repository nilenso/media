* CONFIGURATION

** The Basics

- ./02-config-files.jpg
- Rails envs are *samples*
- file-based or token-based
  - token-based: heroku
  - token-based: cascading (priority) config trees

** Push vs. Pull

- ./03-config-envs-approach.jpg

** What and is not configuration?

*** This is configuration:

- dev / meta:
  - db
  - external services
  - flags
  - timeouts
  - i18n? (debatable but probably not)

*** This is not configuration:

- i18n ...is a category unto itself

- user preferences, even if that user is an "admin" of any sort
  - on the desktop, preferences may be user-level config (e.g. Slack)
