* PROJECT MANAGEMENT

** scoping

- inception is mostly about "why"
- try to cut similar sized chunks of work
  - alternatively, estimate t-shirt sizes: S/M/L or 1, 2, 3
  - PM, customer, QA should estimate as a sanity check ONLY
  - designers' estimates can be included with devs' estimates
- try to estimate on a weekly basis... anything finer grained than that is
  likely self-delusion
- fill up 3 weeks and take an average. does it feel right?

** measurement

- "yeserday's weather" tends to be shockingly accurate
- give yourself a wider window (2 or 3 weeks) to avoid sharp spikes at Diwali
- prefer one week iterations as a basic skeleton
- prefer the simplest estimation possible
- never change estimation approach mid-project
- DO NOT compensate for "irregularities" -- sick leave is real, holidays are real
  - consider making an exception for dengue, sabbaticals, etc.

** projection

- take what was measured, plot it against the scope, project into the future
- do not adjust, do not compensate, do not pad work/estimates
- pad the end (of a release, of a project) for inevitable stumblings
- be honest with everyone about what you see

** individual

*** is the software *done*? how do you know? (actually answer this question)

- acceptance criteria -- who wrote them? did they check?
- testing -- what kinds?
- deployed -- where?
- used -- by whom?
- feature flags -- which ones?
- old features -- removed or disabled?
- old data -- deprecated or deleted?
- old APIs -- backward-compatible, deprecated, or deleted?
  - client libraries?
- "just one more thing" -- is there anything pending on your plate?
  - what happens if you die tomorrow?

** team

*** is the software *done*? how do you know? (again)

- dependencies -- who owns them?
- follow-up -- who's talking? who's fault is it if it doesn't happen? (YOURS)
- what happens if the entire team dies tomorrow? maturity:
  1) process
  2) documentation
  3) automation
  4) eliminate process altogether (zero work, not ad-hoc work)

** guidelines

1) README: central starting point
   1a) meta-projects and meta-readme (wiki)
2) publish everything
3) list stakeholders
4) capture a TODO list: project wall  | Executive
5) capture HOW-TOs:     documentation | Operations
