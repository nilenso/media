* Introduction to Experimentation (7-8 mins - aim for 10)
- Cox and Reid definition of Experimentational Research
- History?
- Usage (much more mature?) in other fields

- Experimentation as we use it
- Treatments
- Coverage
- Reports
- Events
- http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36500.html (call out that the most disruptive paper came out 5 years ago, so it's a relatively new subject, and needs a lot of whiteboarding before jumping in. There aren't established tools/practices out there).
- Google, Bing, LinkedIn & Netflix
- https://github.com/StaplesLabs/HeartofGold/blob/4205a588cdef9abc9d5739ce168532b4560d34a7/docs/hog-api-documentation.org#great-material-on-experimentation-infrastructure

- Why not use the tools available for experimentation? (Say it in passing as a conclusion of the first segment may be)
  - There were features of our client's business that made experimentation more involved than a regular change of a button color.
  - SLA, EP sits in the path of all the calls.
  - Raw data analysis.

** Segway: SLA (low latency)

* Implementation (6-8 mins)
** why clojure/jvm? (3-4 mins)
- let's us focus on the actual problem
- expressiveness
- low latency
- established languauge of choice amongst the teams

- examples (dispatch table, report-graphs vs figure-graphs, current get-buckets/mutual-recursion?)
#+begin_src clojure
(def dispatch-table
  {[c/precise c/messy]        :default
   [c/precise c/precise]      :precise
   [c/precise c/unrestricted] :unrestricted
   [c/messy   c/messy]        :messy
   [c/messy   c/precise]      :default
   [c/messy   c/unrestricted] :unrestricted})
#+end_src
- the actual computation functions are in-memory higher order functions whichg are evaluated during runtime.
- using pure, uniformly distributed allocation function for bucketing.

** Persistence? - postgres (3-4 mins)

-- The following vars and their curves with increasing db size
- single write - SLA
- cold/warm read - SLA
- report without aggregates - changing data, drill down analysis
- bulk import - profiling
- backup and restore - for archival, safety

(redis(?), datomic/ddb, datomic/pg, pg)

** Segway : eveyrthing worked perfectly

* Simulation Testing (7-8 min - aim for 10)
- Take inspiration from mtnygard's talk at Strangeloop 2014

** Good
- test a complicated system. In our case, ensure the stickiness of treatment, unbiased allocation of treatments, correctness of reports
- <architecture diagram>
- state machine for simulant
- Simulant and Causatum
- diagnostics
- helped us uncover some critical bugs

** difficult parts
- adding simulation testing as part of CI
  - so many moving parts
  - mostly a failure on our part

** content for slides
- Why simulation testing?
  - generating confidence that your system will behave as expected during runtime
  - humans can't possibly think of all the test cases
  - Simulation testing is the extension of property based testing to whole systems
  - testing a system or a collection of systems as a whole
  - definitely some non-determinism
- Structure of our simulation testing system
  - setting up the test, state machine to create streams of actions
  - setting up target system
  - run the simulation, record the data
  - get reports from the target system
  - validate the recorded data
- Things we test
  - are all our requests are returning non-500 responses under the given SLA.
  - stickiness (use better words)
  - the reports returned by the target system match the numbers we recorded when running teh simulation
- Tools:
  - Simulant
  - Causatum


Notes:
- watch out sub-section in each section?

* Reporting (10-12 mins)
- datomic

** reporting on postgres (5-6 mins)
- tried using postgres as a reporting db
  - indices
  - optimized queries
  - different config between olTp and olAP
- as db size increases, beyond a certain point it becomes unreasoable to expect postgres to work
  - work arounds are there which we don't use, different schema, no continuous streaming
- still works for live reporting
- <cluster architecture diagram>

** ETL + OLAP (5-6 min)
- event streams
- core.async
- Redshift
